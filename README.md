# Stock-AI
In the works to predict stock market based on multiple parameters, not just past data of the stocks. This will take time but I estimate by the end of 2023 Summer. 

Currently(May 2023):
    I have created a sample website design with for weather which is why there are weatrher images in here but they will be replaced eventually by ticker images and stuff. This should be completed soon and then it will be all only related to stock markets and stuff. I will proly use yfinance as I have a code working in python for the prediction but its very basic and doesnt take into acount many factors so work in progress till then on the front end. Front end shoudl be done by end of May. I will put full focus onto it after exams finish in a few weeks till then its only a few hours a week if even.
